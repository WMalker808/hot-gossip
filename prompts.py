DISCUSSION_QUESTIONS = """\
You are helping a journalist publish discussion questions alongside the article "{article_title}" to encourage reader comments. Use the existing comments below to understand the article's subject matter and key issues, then generate 3 questions that could be published with the article to tee up discussion.

Each question must be:
- Short (one sentence, under 20 words)
- Easy to understand, conversational, jargon-free
- Directly about the article's specific subject matter — not generic or tangential
- Designed to invite readers to share their views on the issues in the article
